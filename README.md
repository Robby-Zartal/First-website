My first "project"
The idea is to create a online photo album for my gf and I. Only people with accounts can view most of the content. If you visit without an account you can only see a select few photos. 
Speaking of accounts I want multiple tiers:
Tier 1 - full access and ability to upload, delete and change which album photos are in. Also have the ability to set visibility of some photos/albums depending on other person's account tier
Tier 2 - view photos made accessible by tier 1 users. No way of uploading, deleting or modifying photo locations

The idea is to have a landing page with a preview section showing recently added photos
An albums page containing the various albums
A modifications page for Tier 1 users allowing modifications, uploads and deletions
Log in and create acc page
Important dates page which is self explanatory

Milestones:
- 14/11: finally happy with the navbar, I spent way too long on that thing
-
